      "Reconstitution: Use bacteriostatic water (never tap or sterile water for multi-dose vials). Draw the volume specified on the product label (e.g., 2 mL), inject into the vial, and swirl gently. Do not shake—agitation can damage the peptide.",
      "Storage: Refrigerate reconstituted peptides at 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C). Do not freeze. Protect from light. Most peptides are stable for 90 days after reconstitution when stored properly. Check product-specific IFU for exact shelf life.",
      "Injection sites: Rotate between abdomen, thigh, and upper arm. Use a clean site each time. Pinch skin, inject subcutaneously at a 90° angle. Dispose of syringes in a sharps container—never in household trash.",
      "Timing: Many peptides are dosed before bed or upon waking. GHRH/GHRP peptides are often taken 2 hours before the first meal or before bed to avoid blunting by food. Follow your product-specific schedule.",
      "Cycling: Some peptides use cycles (e.g., 5 days on/2 off, or 60 days on/30 off) to support natural hormone rhythms. Your provider will recommend the appropriate protocol.",

    excerpt: "General guidelines for supplement and nutriment use.",
    content: [
      "Take with food or water unless otherwise directed. Fat-soluble compounds absorb better with a meal containing healthy fats.",
      "Storage: Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Refrigerate if the label specifies. Keep lids tightly closed.",
      "Consistency: Many nutriments work best when taken at the same time each day. Set a reminder if needed.",
      "Interactions: Inform your provider of all supplements and medications you take. Some nutriments can interact with prescription drugs.",
      "Quality: Choose products from reputable sources. Third-party testing (e.g., USP, NSF) can verify purity and potency.",

      "Lathmized NAD+ is a stabilized form of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) designed for improved bioavailability and shelf life compared to standard NAD+.",
      "Administration: Typically sublingual or oral. Hold sublingual forms under the tongue for the time specified. Do not swallow immediately—allow absorption through the oral mucosa.",
      "Timing: Many users take NAD+ in the morning or before physical or cognitive demand. Follow your provider's recommendation.",
      "Storage: Store in a cool, dry place. Some formulations may require refrigeration—check the label.",
      "Cycling: Some protocols use intermittent dosing (e.g., 5 days on/2 off) to support cellular response. Your provider will tailor the protocol to your goals.",
