  { id: "1", question: "What are peptides?", answer: "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that support various bodily functions. Therapeutic peptides can support weight management, recovery, hormonal balance, and longevity." },
  { id: "2", question: "How are peptides administered?", answer: "Most HealthCode360 peptides are administered subcutaneously (under the skin) in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Rotate injection sites. Clean site, pinch skin, inject at 90° angle. Dispose of syringe in sharps container." },
  { id: "3", question: "How should I store reconstituted peptides?", answer: "Refrigerate after reconstitution at 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C). Do not freeze. Protect from light. Discard after 90 days." },
  { id: "4", question: "What if I miss a dose?", answer: "For weekly GLP-1 medications: if more than 5 days have passed, skip and resume weekly schedule. Do not double dose. For other peptides, take within 5 days if remembered; otherwise skip and resume your regular schedule." },
  { id: "5", question: "How do I reconstitute peptides?", answer: "Each product specifies a Bacteriostatic Water volume (e.g., 2 mL) for reconstitution. Draw the correct amount, inject into the vial, swirl gently. Do not shake." },
  { id: "6", question: "Can I stack peptides?", answer: "Some peptides stack well (e.g., AOD 9604 with GLP-1). Always consult your provider before combining peptides." },
  { id: "7", question: "Are these compounds FDA approved?", answer: "Peptides are compounded for use under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Use only as prescribed. Individual results may vary." },
