H GUARD HEMA & LYMPH CLEANSER

KEY ACTIONS:

TRADITIONAL & CURRENT USES:

NUTRIMENTSTM H-Guard : Hema and Lymph Cleanser has broad beneficial potential for cleansing the blood and lymph of

toxins, while strengthening the immune system. An over-burdened, toxic circulatory/blood/lymphatic system results in skin

disorders of all types, such as eczema, psoriasis, hives and rashes, joint pain, circulatory disorders and skin conditions.

In addition, H-Guard is traditionally used in the treatment of swollen lymph nodes, throat infections (including strep and staph

infections), tonsillitis, ear infections, sinus infections, eye infections, intestinal flu, skin infections, respiratory infections (both

bacterial and viral), bronchitis and pneumonia, herpes, and lymphatic cancer and tumors by cleansing the lymph of infection. In

doing so, H-Guard activates immunity and restrains infection, including the prevention and treatment of colds and other viral

conditions.

We highly recommend the use of a B-Guard : Bowel and Parasite Cleanser and L-Guard : Live Cleanser while using H-Guard.

BURDOCK ROOT (Arctium lappa)

Burdock Root contains active ingredients that can remove toxins from the bloodstream. Along with being a

blood purifier, Burdock Root also has many benefits for cleansing the liver and supporting liver health.

ECHINACEA ANGUSTIFOLIA (Echinacea angustifolia)

Echinacea is used in traditionally medicine to prophylactic treat against colds, flu and upper respiratory

infections, for regulating strengthening and modulating the immune system, as a decongestant of mu-

cous that accumulates during upper respiratory infections and as a powerful antibacterial (against UTIs),

anti-inflammatory (against organ inflammation), anti-allergenic (against mold and other airborne aller-

gens), and an antiviral (to support overall healthy immune system).

MARSHMALLOW ROOT (Althaea officinals)

Marshmallow Root is useful in conditions that irritate the mucus membranes such as pharyngitis, tonsil-

litis, dry cough, sore throat, reflux, gastritis and ulcers. Helps reduce skin irritation, such as sun burn and

psoriasis. Aids in preventing cardiovascular disease by reducing inflammation and increasing HDL choles-

terol, increases breast milk production, and helps prevent Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) by flushing toxins

from the bladder and blood. Improves digestion by preventing ulcers from developing.

LICORICE ROOT (Glycrrhiza glabra)

Licorice Root is used for internal cleansing of the blood, lymph and intestinal tract, and is traditionally

regarded as an important herb for treating kidney and respiratory ailments.

SAGE LEAF (Salvia officinalis)

Sage Leaf is used to tonify the blood and lymphatic systems. The lymphatic system, one of the most

important systems in your body, made up of nodes, vessels, ducts, and glands, helps eliminate waste and

toxins from cells, and controls the flow of bacteria-fighting immune cells throughout your entire body.

By promoting lymphatic drainage, Sage Leaf helps keep your lymphatic system healthy which is crucial

for detoxification, immunity, and overall good health.

CLOVES (Syzygium aromaticum)

Cloves help address lymphatic stagnancy and lymphedema, which if not treated creates swelling in

tissues, body bloating, and glandular or joint swelling. Lymphedema can produce mild discomfort to

severe pain and disfigurement. Untreated, it can become a long-term, painful, depressing disability.

IRISH MOSS (Chondrus crispus)

Irish Moss combined with Burdock Root helps purify the blood, strengthen the lymphatic system,

reduces inflammation, and naturally helps fight cancer in the body.

BLUE FLAG (Iris versicolor)

Blue Flag is used in traditional Western medicine for skin diseases, and to detoxify the blood and

lymphatic system, particularly when accompanied with poor liver and bowel function.

PIPER LONGUM (Piper longum)

Piper Longum is used in ayurvedic medicine to help assist the body against asthma, diarrhea, gastric

problem, indigestion, stomach pain, organ detoxifier, food metabolizer, for poor circulation and to

detoxify the lungs, spleen, liver and lymphatic system.
