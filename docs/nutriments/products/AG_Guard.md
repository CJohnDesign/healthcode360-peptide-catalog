KEY ACTIONS:

SCHIZANDRA BERRIES (Schisandra chinensis)

A powerful antioxidant that has been traditionally used to fight free radical damage, which causes pre-

mature aging and cellular and tissue damage and lowers inflammatory responses. This widely used anti-

carcinogen helps stall the development of atherosclerosis, balance blood sugar, prevent diabetes and bal-

ance endocrine acidity. This adaptogen herb raises the body’s resistance to environmental stress, anxiety,

toxin exposure, emotional trauma, mental fatigue and mental illness. Schizandra improves liver health,

mental clarity and fatigue.

SIBERIAN GINSENG ROOT (Eleuthero coccus senticosus)

Siberian Ginseng Root helps the body handle physical, chemical and biological stresses, which is linked to

depression, gastrointestinal discomfort, inflammation, weight gain, heart disease and sleep disorders by

suppressing cortisol production via the adrenal gland. Siberian ginseng is an effective anti-viral and anti-

fatigue adaptogen.

RHODIOLA (Rhodiola rosea)

Rhodiola was proven to decrease stress cortisol, burn-out and mental fatigue. Psychological stress can

induce fatigue syndrome, which is characterized by long-term exhaustion, physical weakness, depression,

lack of drive, poor concentration, and difficulty sleeping. Consumers often treat stress-related fatigue

with stimulants. Rhodiola root extract has stimulant and stress-protective (or adaptogenic) properties.

ASHWAGANDHA ROOT POWDER (Withania somnifera)

An Ayurvedic herb that has several studies confirming that it relieves anxiety and stress and helps with

restful sleep. Ashwagandha is also traditionally used to increase vitality and muscle strength as well as

increase sexual response in females.

Adrenal Glandular Powder is derived from bovine source. Adrenal glandular therapy has been used

for centuries to help improve adrenal function, fatigue, emotional and physical stress, depression,

inflammation, lowered resistance to illness, severe allergies, asthma, and certain skin conditions such as

eczema and psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.

LICORICE ROOT EXTRACT (Glycyrrhiza glabra)

Licorice Root Extract assists the adrenals by preventing the breakdown of cortisol, one of the major

hormones produced by the adrenal glands to combat stress. Its cortisol sparing effects help in maintaining

energy levels which results in a better response to stressful situations.
