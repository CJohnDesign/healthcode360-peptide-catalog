U GUARD URINARY TRACT CLEANSER

KEY ACTIONS:

TRADITIONAL & CURRENT USES:

NUTRIMENTSTM U-Guard : Urinary Tract Cleanser is a potent and effective urinary tract cleanser. Utilizing a high-potency

herbal combination of Echinacea Purpurea, Cranberry, Uva Ursi, and Turmeric, U-Guard is targeted to relieve urinary tract

discomfort and reduce the likelihood of urinary tract infection.

The Cranberry Extract is a powerful concentration of 12:1 potency. The medicinal action of cranberry has prompted much sci-

entific discussion. It was first hypothesized that acidification of the urine contributed to an antibacterial effect that causes UTI.

The current clinical tests focuses primarily on cranberry’s ability to prevent bacterial binding to host cell surface membranes.

Cranberry has been found to specifically inhibit hemagglutination of E. coli, which is the main cause of urinary tract infection.

It is important to avoid sugars, yeast, and alcohol when onset of bladder infection. Also, unsweetened Cranberry Juice, con-

sumed proactively can also decrease the chance of UTI infection.

INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS AND ATTRIBUTES:

Cranberry Fruit Extract (Vaccinium oxycoccos)

Cranberry Fruit Extract has been found to specifically inhibit hemagglutination of E. coli, which is the main

cause of urinary tract infection. Cranberry was first hypothesized that acidification of the urine contributed

to an antibacterial effect. The current proposed mechanism of action focuses primarily on cranberry’s ability

to prevent bacterial binding to host cell surface membranes.

ECHINACEA PURPUREA STANDARDIZED EXTRACT (Echinacea purpurea)

Echinacea is used traditionally in medicine to prophylactic treat against colds, flu and upper respiratory

infections, for regulating strengthening and modulating the immune system, as a decongestant of

mucous that accumulates during upper respiratory infections and as a powerful antibacterial (against

UTIs), anti-inflammatory (against organ inflammation), anti-allergenic (against mold and other airborne

allergens), and an antiviral (to support overall healthy immune system). Historically, Echinacea is typically

used for colds, influenza and upper respiratory infections. It is also used to help heal skin abrasions and

fungal infections. In a Meta analysis Echinacea has been proven to actually prevent colds and flu up to

50%, and it might shorten the duration and frequency.

UVA URSI LEAF (Arctostaphylas uva ursi)

Uva Ursi Leaf is used traditionally to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) and cystitis (bladder

inflammation). One preliminary study found that Uva Ursi when in combination with other herbal

extracts specific for bladder infection helped prevent recurrent UTIs.

HORSETAIL HERB (Equisetum arvense)

Horsetail is used for edema (fluid retention), kidney and bladder stones, urinary tract infections,

incontinence (the inability to control urination), and general disturbances of the kidney and bladder.

Horsetail is also used in traditional medicine for balding; tuberculosis; jaundice; hepatitis; brittle

fingernails; joint diseases; gout; osteoarthritis; weak bones (osteoporosis); frostbite; weight loss; heavy

menstrual periods; and uncontrolled bleeding (hemorrhage) of the nose, lung, or stomach.

CURCUMIN C3 COMPLEX (Curcuma longa)

Curcumin has been subject to rigorous testing over the last 50 years. Although few large-scale human

trials have been completed, hundreds of experiments conducted by researchers around the globe have

demonstrated curcumin’s ability to halt or prevent certain types of cancer, stop inflammation, improve

cardiovascular health, prevent cataracts, kill or inhibit the toxic effects of certain microbes including

fungi and dangerous parasites, and protect, at least in the laboratory, against the damaging effects

of heterocyclic amines (potentially carcinogenic compounds found in some cooked foods). As one

investigative team declared: “Curcumin has been proven to exhibit remarkable anti-carcinogenic, anti-

inflammatory, and antioxidant properties.” Regarding curcumin’s potential benefits for the prevention

and treatment of colon cancer, one research team commented: “Naturally occurring COX-2 inhibitors

such as curcumin and certain phytosterols have been proven to be effective as chemo-preventive agents

against colon carcinogenesis with minimal gastrointestinal toxicity.”
