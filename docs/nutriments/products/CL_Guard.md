Red Rice Yeast has been used by the Chinese for hundreds of years to lower cholesterol and maintain

healthy cholesterol levels. This product will not create any harmful bad effects like many statins containing

pharmaceutical drugs. Red Rice Yeast is a statin and should be avoided by individuals with liver problems or

cholesterol levels.
