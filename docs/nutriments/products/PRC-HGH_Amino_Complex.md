PRC-HGH

Amino Complex

What if you are already suffering the ill effects of aging? Perhaps you could drop 20 years and stay that way to age

100, adding an additional 20 or 30 years to your normal life span. This could allow you to live long enough to take

advantage of scientific breakthroughs yet to come and maybe further extend your healthy life span to 120, 130 years

and more.

People have always dreamt about existence of an effective anti-aging deterrent or a way of reversing age. Scientist

today feel that in the not too distant future the average life expectancy can and will be extended to 100 years of age

and more. Some expert’s even feel that the human body can live will into the 120s and 140s.

Thanks to better medicine, replacement surgery, nutrition, supplements and now, perhaps most important of all,

HGH.

As published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the results of HGH clinical trials are startling to say the least.

Working with volunteers aged 61 to 81 at the Medical College of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Dr. Daniel Rudman used

synthetically manufactured HGH to replicate what is created naturally in the body’s own pituitary gland.

The initial observed results: Six months of injections reversed the aging process from 10 to 20 years in the patients

who received HGH. In the controlled group that didn’t receive HGH, the normal aging process continued.

The Ultimate Anti-Ager, Human Growth Hormone (HGH) is washing away the disease of aging. HGH affects

almost every cell in the body, helping to regenerate skin, bones, heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys to their former

youthful levels. The immune system is revitalized. Heart attack and stroke risk factors are diminished. Emphysema

patients find their oxygen intake improves. Osteoporosis is prevented. Wrinkled skin is restored to youthfulness,

diminished sexual organs are restored to former proportions, presbyopic eyes focus properly, hair color is restored,

and that’s just for starters.

The most effective Anti-Obesity “agent” ever discovered, PRC-HGH revs up the metabolism to former highs,

selectively reducing the abdomen, hips, waist, and thighs while at the same time increasing muscle mass. After six

months of usage without exercise, an 8.8% increase in lean muscle mass and 14.4% loss of fat is reported on

average.

As a powerful aphrodisiac, PRC-HGH restores sexual potency and sexuality in both men and women. A mood

elevator, it restores a youthful sense of wellness and a zest for life along with the deepest levels of sleep.

Called “Cosmetic Surgery in a Bottle” facial wrinkles are smoothed. The skin regains thickness and youthful

contours, as it becomes more elastic and hydrated. Super healing properties can regrow burned skin and close

ulcerated wounds. Hair growth is improved and restored, nails strengthened, cellulite removed.

Some of the latest research indicates that PRC-HGH may even hold great promise for Alzheimer’s patients.

What is HGH?

HGH or Human Growth Hormone (also called somatotrophin) is produced in the anterior of the pituitary gland deep

inside the brain, where it is one of the most abundant hormones secreted. It influences the growth of cells, bones,

muscles, and organs throughout the body. Production peaks at adolescence when accelerated growth occurs. If

growing children have too little they remain as dwarfs, while if they have too much they become giants.

HGH is one of the many endocrine hormones, like estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, Melatonin, and DHEA, that

all decline in production with age. While many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the effects of

aging, HGH reaches far beyond the scope of any of these hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but

also it acts to significantly reverse a broad range of the signs and symptoms associated with the aging process.

Daily growth hormone secretion diminishes with age to the extent that a 60-year-old may secrete only 25% of the

HGH secreted by a 20-year-old.

By ages 70 to 80, virtually everyone is deficient in growth hormone, resulting in SDS, or somatotrophin (growth

hormone) Deficiency Syndrome. Symptoms include loss of muscle and increase of fat, decreased physical mobility,

socialization and energy levels, diminished healing ability, a greater life expectancy. In otherwords, the symptoms

of the disease called aging.

The decline of growth hormone with age, sometimes referred to as somatopause, is directly associated with many

symptoms of aging, including wrinkling, gray hair, decreased energy and sexual function, increased body fat and

cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and more. Many of these symptoms have been associated with younger adults

who have growth hormone deficiency; in a sense a biological age of these adults has exceeded their chronological

age.

The goods news, however, is clinical evidence demonstrates that by replacing growth hormone we can dramatically

reverse these symptoms to restore hair color and growth, regain bone tissue, increase energy and significantly reduce

body fat, plus a score of other health benefits.

In 1990, groundbreaking research by Daniel Rudman, M.D., shook the medical world. (Published in the prestigious

New England Journal of Medicine) with the announcement that 12 men, aged 61 to 81 had reversed up to the

equivalent of 20 years of aging in six months with synthetically manufactured growth hormone injections.

Until recently, growth hormone therapy has only been available in the form of injections that have been

prohibitively expensive and difficult to use. The cost for HGH injections in the U.S. runs from $800 to $2,500 per

month. This limited the amount of people that could afford the injections to the rich and famous.

Natural secretagogues (hormone precursors) may be our best hope for raising growth hormone in an entirely

physiologic manner, because they stimulate the endocrine system to release its own growth hormone. In a process

called stacking, that is packaging the right nutrients in the right proportions and taking them at the right time, you

can derive optimal benefits – without using synthetics and needles.

This combined with a program of dietary manipulation and HGH-releasing exercises, offers even greater results.

Among the HGH-releasers listed by Dr. Klatz are the amino acids. He writes, “ The smart money says to stack

lysine with arginine, ornithine and or glutamine.”

Arginine is an essential amino acid, meaning it is not manufactured in the body; it has to be supplied in the food we

eat. Claims for arginine include an increase in fat burning and muscle building. Arginine strengthens the thymus

gland, increasing its weight and activity, boosting immunity and fighting cancer. It also promotes healing of burns

and wounds while generally protecting and detoxifying the body. Finally it enhances male fertility.

The amino acid Lysine boosts the effectiveness of arginine and affects growth. On its own, it works by assisting the

body’s own ability to secrete HGH naturally.

We have now made PRC-HGH available to the masses in a sublingual liquid form for about $4.00 per day. Our

product contains 191 amino acids, all from botanical sources. A three-month commitment is highly recommended,

although many people will notice immediate effects. Furthermore, there are no reported complications as opposed

to synthetic hormones. The retail price is $95.95 per one ounce bottle, which is a 30-day supply.

Some information for this article has been taken from Dr. Ronald Kaltz’ book, Grow Young with HGH.

Overview

PRC-HGH is important for a number of reasons in older individuals. It slows down and even reverses many of the

aging processes that occur in the body.

Since aging is now considered a disease and not just a normal occurrence, anyone who wants to maintain their

youthful vigor and endurance should include an effective growth hormone therapy as a part of their health program.

Until now, PRC-HGH has only been available by expensive injection for the wealthy. It has been used in Europe

and the United States for approximately 15 years with gratifying results.

Based on numerous studies with Human Growth Hormone, medical science has already proven that it is possible to

reverse 10-20 years of aging in as little as six months of therapy. PRC-HGH, therefore, represents the best and most

important discovery in the field of life extension and age reversal; and is our best hope against the “war” on aging.

PRC-HGH is a food supplement and not a drug. It is a synergistic combination of 191 amino acids, all from natural

plant sources. It is actually a stimulator of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, which is as potent as the actual growth

hormone itself. The problem in the past has been that this insulin-like growth hormone or growth factor has been

broken down in the stomach by the bile acids and has not been available for absorption.

PRC-HGH with its proprietary delivery system eliminates this problem in an all-natural plant based proprietary

formula, which can be taken orally and may do some of the following:

1) Reverse many of the problems that are caused by aging, such as wrinkled skin, increased body fat, decreased

muscle mass, increased cholesterol and blood pressure, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function,

impaired neurological functions, such as Parkinson’s and Multiple Sclerosis, weakened bones, depression, reduced

vision, and hair loss.

2) Retard the aging process in the body.
