W GUARD WEIGHT LOSS FIBER

KEY ACTIONS:

PREBIOTIC FIBER

Supports gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the large intestine. It also promotes

the growth of Bifidobacteria which is important for liver function as well as the small intestine. This prebiotic

fiber also promotes the growth of butyrate, which is a short-chain fatty acid that fuels gut cells, maintains

the gut lining, and combats inflammation by balancing intestinal pH. Important for digestive health, this fiber

absorbs water in the gut, softens the stool, improves motility, and relieves constipation. For weight loss, this

prebiotic fiber curbs hunger and increases the feeling of being full, suppressing appetite.

GARCINIA CAMBOGIA EXTRACT

A safe supplement for regulating body fat metabolism containing hydroxy citrate, an organic compound

obtained from the dry rind of the fruit from the Garcinia Cambogia plant. Research shows that those

taking Garcinia Cambogia Extract had a significant decrease in food intake, body weight gain, epidermal

fat, and serum triglyceride.

PHENYLETHYLAMINE

(PEA)- has been shown to activate dopamine and affect moods and behavior, decreasing ADHD and

lack of concentration or brain fog, fatigue and depression, low motivation and improves low libido. For

weight loss, PEA reduces fluid retention.

L-THEANINE

L-Theanine is effective in decreasing fat accumulation and maintaining body weight due to its appetite

suppressive effects.

L-CARNITINE FUMARATE

L-Carnitine Fumarate is formed in the liver and kidney and is made from two amino acids, lysine and

methionine. Carnitine is known to promote fat metabolism, aiding in healthy weight loss, especially when

utilized with a healthy diet and exercise. L-Carnitine plays an important role in the transportation of fats

to the mitochondria, where these fats are converted into energy. Not only does reduce the amount of fat

stored in the body, it also helps visceral belly fat, which is the type of fat that surrounds your vital organs

and leads to fatty liver disease. L-Carnitine boosts the amount of calories your body burns by increasing

thermogenic energy, even while at rest.

CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACID

Conjugated Linoleic Acid is known to decrease fat mass.
