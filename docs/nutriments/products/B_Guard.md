B GUARD BOWEL & PARASITE CLEANSER

KEY ACTIONS:

TRADITIONAL & CURRENT USES:

NUTRIMENTSTM B-Guard : Bowel and Parasite Cleanser is a highly effective herbal combination used to moisten, lubricate

and cleanse the intestinal tract, promote thorough bowel movements while destructing and eradicating parasitic infection of

all types. This formulation has broad beneficial potential in the fight against constipation, intestinal toxicity, intestinal upset

and inflammation, abdominal distension and intestinal gas, purifies the intestines, eliminates food stagnation by removing old

food stuff, and clears intestinal microorganisms and toxins. B-Guard also promotes bile flow, while stimulating the liver and gall

bladder.

INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS AND ATTRIBUTES:

CASCARA SAGRADA BARK (Rhamnus purshia)

Active constituents in Cascara Sagrada, called anthraquinoes slow down the absorption of water and

electrolytes in the intestines. Because of this, stool volume increases as it absorbs the excess water, which

increases pressure in the intestines. This action promotes muscle contractions, speeding elimination of the

bowel. Cascara Sagrada is considered a gentle laxative, resulting in less watery or loose stool.

BENTONITE CLAY (Montmorillinite)

Bentonite Clay is a powerful detoxifying agent, which is called anti poly-cationic, which leads to the elim-

ination of negative charged toxins, such as pesticides, herbicides, heavy metal poisoning, yeast and mold,

and other toxic chemicals.

BUCKTHORNE BARK (Rhamnus frangula)

Buckthorne Bark assists in the body’s natural detoxification process, relieving constipation and other

digestive issues due to its natural laxative properties. Buckthorne Bark helps shape stools into larger,

softer volumes, effectively easing bowel movements.

FLAX SEED (Linum usitatissimum)

Flaxseed contains high amounts of fiber found in the seed coat. Flaxseed is traditionally used for

constipation, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and swelling of the kidneys in people with lupus. When

taken before eating, it can suppress appetite and can regulate how much bad cholesterol the body

absorbs from food.
