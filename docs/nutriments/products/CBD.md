KEY ACTIONS:

TRADITIONAL & CURRENT USES:

NUTRIMENTS TM Azteca CBD (Cannabidiol) Shot is designed to provide relief for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic

stress disorder. Cannabidiol promotes sleep. Part of CBD’s popularity is that it purports to be “nonpsychoactive.”

INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS AND ATTRIBUTES:

CANNABIDIOL (CBD)

Cannabidiol is derived from the hemp plant and does not contain any psychoactive compounds found

in the marijuana plant. CBD is clinically used for epilepsy and known to decrease pain associated with

inflammatory conditions. Cannabidiol is also shown in clinical studies to be effective in reducing mental

disorders such as anxiety, depression and PTSD and helps lower cravings for tobacco and heroin and

lessen cravings for alcohol, cannabis, opiates and stimulates.

D-RIBOSE

A molecule known as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is critical for promoting cellular energy flow.

Healthy, active cells constantly replenish their supply of ATP. D-Ribose, a carbohydrate molecule found

in every living organism, is essential in supporting the production of ATP. By helping to support cellular

energy production, D-Ribose may be especially beneficial for supporting heart health.

VITAMIN B-12 (as Methylcobalamin)

the body. Vitamin B12 helps your body produce energy, boosting memory and mood, making red blood
