Z GUARD 	ZOMBIE CELL CLEANSER

KEY ACTIONS:

TRADITIONAL & CURRENT USES:

NUTRIMENTSTM Zombie Cell Cleanser : is a highly effective nutraceutical combination used to eliminate the Zombie Cells,

which are live cells that have no positive function in the body and are closely linked to aging and oxidation at a cellular level.

Z-GUARD works systemically throughout the entire body, improving age related stress on organs as well as the blood.

Zombie cells are cells that are still alive but have reached their lifespan and no longer function properly and do not multiply or

divide like healthy cells. These damaged cells are due to the ill effects of aging and associated with increased inflammation and

immune compromised conditions, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s and other age related dysfunctions.

Clinically, Z-GUARD, when used regularly, can eliminate signs of aging, including wrinkled skin.

LONG PEPPER FRUIT POWDER (Piper longum)

Indian long pepper is used to improve appetite and digestion, as well as treat stomachache, heartburn, indi-

gestion, intestinal gas, diarrhea, and cholera. May also help to reduce inflammation (swelling) and kill cancer

cells. One of these chemicals called piperine also seems to change the lining of the intestines. This change

allows some drugs and other substances taken by mouth to be better absorbed by the body.

BUXUS SINICA POWDERED EXTRACT

Boxwood extract is used to treat HIV/AIDS and to boost immunity. Boxwood is also used for arthritis and

as a “blood-detoxifying agent.”

QUERCITIN (as Quercitin Dehydrate)

Quercetin may help protect against heart disease and cancer. Quercetin can also help stabilize the cells

that release histamine in the body and thereby have an anti-inflammatory and antihistamine effect.
