OLIVE LEAF EXTRACT

Olive Leaf Extract helps prevent LDL (bad) cholesterol from building up in the arteries. This effect helps

increase blood flow and lower blood pressure, which can reduce the risk of heart disease.

BERBERINE SULFATE

A powerful antibacterial agent proved to not only reduce blood sugar levels, but also reduce blood

pressure and improve vasodilation in lab specimens.

LYCOPENE EXTRACT

Lycopene Extract significantly decreased systolic blood pressure compared to placebo in clinical studies,

whereas the effect on diastolic blood pressure was not significant. Whereas both systolic and diastolic

blood pressure are equally important, most studies show that high systolic pressure pose a greater risk of

stroke and heart disease than elevated diastolic pressure.
