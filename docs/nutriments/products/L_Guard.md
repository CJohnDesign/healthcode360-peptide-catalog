cleaning organ in the body for many of the toxins and pollutants we consume. Today many of the substances we consume from

our water, food and drink are heavier then the substances our body was designed to eliminate, it is important to assist the body

in cleansing the liver of these toxic residues.

MILK THISTLE SEED (Silybum marianum)

Milk Thistle is used to treat liver damage due to conditions like alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty

liver disease, hepatitis and even liver cancer. Milk Thistle is also used to protect the liver against toxins like

amatoxin. Studies have shown improvements in liver function in people with liver diseases who have taken a

Milk Thistle supplement, suggesting it could help reduce liver inflammation and liver damage. Milk Thistle is

thought to reduce damage to the liver caused by free radicals, which are produced when your liver metab-

cirrhosis of the liver due to alcoholic liver disease.
