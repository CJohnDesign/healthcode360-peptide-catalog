tration of plasma cholesterols in blood and has been used in traditional medicine to treat high cholesterol,

diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other conditions.

In clinical trials L-Theanine was linked to glucose regulation, lipid, and protein metabolism via

insulin and AMPK and their downstream signaling pathways. L-Theanine has also been linked to

increased metal clarity and decreased anxiety.

CHROMIUM

Some studies have shown that chromium supplements may be helpful for people with type 2

diabetes and insulin resistance (prediabetes). Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a role

in how insulin helps the body regulate blood sugar levels. Low chromium levels can increase

blood sugar, triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood), cholesterol levels, and increase the risk for

a number of conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.

ALPHA LIPOIC ACID (ALA)

The potential beneficial effects of Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) on both prevention and treatment of

diabetes have been shown in multiple studies, proven to have a role in preventing

ß cell destruction and enhancing insulin sensitivity.

VANADIUM

Vanadium has shown to have a significant effect on blood sugar in people with diabetes and

glucose metabolism.

BERBERINE SULFATE HCL (Berberis aristata)

Berberine is a bitter-tasting and yellow-colored chemical. It might help strengthen the

heartbeat, kill bacteria, help regulate how the body uses sugar in the blood, and help reduce

swelling.

TUMERIC EXTRACT 4:1 (Curcumin longa)

Tumeric has shown in clinical studies to stabilize blood sugar levels and assist in making diabetes

more manageable.

GYMNEMA SYLVESTRE EXTRACT 4:1 (Gymnema sylvestre)

Gymnema Sylvestre Extract is known to increase insulin secretion, which in turns helps lower

blood sugar levels.

CASCARA SAGRADA BARK (Frangula purshiana)

Cascara sagrada is a shrub. The dried bark used to be FDA approved as an OTC laxative for constipation.

It’s now used in supplements for laxative and cleansing of the colon.

bowel syndrome. Peppermint has been used in traditional medicine to relief inflammation, headaches,
