NUTRIMENTS TM 15-Day Total Body Cleanse : is a comprehensive, holistic approach to assisting the body in cleansing toxins,

old food stuff, parasites, and microorganisms from the body. This natural and effective body detoxifying system assists the body

in cleansing the bowel, blood, lymph, kidney, liver while eliminating parasitic microorganisms from the body. Cleansing these

eliminatory organs is vital to the circulatory system and overall general good health. The liver is the main cleansing organ in the

body, up-taking many of the toxins and pollutants we consume. A clean liver is vital to proper immune function. Cleansing the

bowel is critical and it is important to eliminate these toxins from the body and into the toilet as the blood, liver, kidney and

lymph work to improve overall good health and clen organ function.

It is estimated that 1 out of 4 people has one or more forms of parasites in their system. The bowel and parasite formula

contained herein is a strong, effective, yet gentle parasite destroy and eliminator. To avoid auto-detoxification of these

unwanted microorganisms and toxins from the system, increasing bowel elimination is vital. Nutriments 15-Day Total Body

Cleanse system is designed to increase elimination, forcing the toxins and microorganism into the toilet with a first thing in

the morning, larger than regular bowel movement.

NUTRIMENTSTM H-Guard : Hema and Lymph Cleanser has broad beneficial po-

tential for cleansing the blood and lymph of toxins, while strengthening the immune

system. An over-burdened, toxic circulatory/blood/lymphatic system results in skin

disorders of all types, such as eczema, psoriasis, hives and rashes, joint pain, circula-

tory disorders and skin conditions.

In addition, H-Guard is traditionally used in the treatment of swollen lymph nodes,

throat infections (including strep and staph infections), tonsillitis, ear infections,

sinus infections, eye infections, intestinal flu, skin infections, respiratory infections

(both bacterial and viral), bronchitis and pneumonia, herpes, and lymphatic cancer

and tumors by cleansing the lymph of infection. In doing so, H-Guard activates im-

munity and restrains infection, including the prevention and treatment of colds and

other viral conditions.

NUTRIMENTSTM L-Guard : Liver Cleanser naturally and effectively assists the

body in the cleansing the liver. The liver is the cleaning organ in the body for

many of the toxins and pollutants we consume. Today many of the substances

we consume from our water, food and drink are heavier then the substances our

body was designed to eliminate, it is important to assist the body in cleansing the

liver of these toxic residues.

This formula contains herbs that have a broad beneficial potential for the treat-

ment of liver congestion. L-Guard also helps naturally detoxify the liver after

alcohol, sugar, fatty foods, coffee, and drug consumption.

NUTRIMENTSTM U-Guard : Urinary Tract Cleanser is a potent and effective

urinary tract cleanser. Utilizing a high-potency herbal combination of Echinacea

Purpurea, Cranberry, Uva Ursi, and Turmeric, U-Guard is targeted to relieve

urinary tract discomfort and reduce the likelihood of urinary tract infection.

The Cranberry Extract is a powerful concentration of 12:1 potency. The medicinal

action of cranberry has prompted much scientific discussion. It was first

hypothesized that acidification of the urine contributed to an antibacterial effect

that causes UTI. The current clinical tests focuses primarily on cranberry’s ability

to prevent bacterial binding to host cell surface membranes. Cranberry has been

found to specifically inhibit hemagglutination of E. coli, which is the main cause

of urinary tract infection.

NUTRIMENTSTM B-Guard : Bowel and Parasite Cleanser is a highly effective

herbal combination used to moisten, lubricate and cleanse the intestinal tract,

promote thorough bowel movements while destructing and eradicating parasitic

infection of all types. This formulation has broad beneficial potential in the

fight against constipation, intestinal toxicity, intestinal upset and inflammation,

abdominal distension and intestinal gas, purifies the intestines, eliminates food

stagnation by removing old food stuff, and clears intestinal microorganisms

and toxins. B-Guard also promotes bile flow, while stimulating the liver and gall

bladder.

## FAQ

Nutriments

15-Day Total Body Cleanse

Frequently Asked Questions

How often should I cleanse?

If you are constipated, you should cleanse as often as you feel you

need to. Normal, regular and healthy elimination (bowel movements) should

occur 2 to 3 times per day. If you aren’t eliminating at this pace, then you

need to assist the body in speeding up your elimination process. If you are

doing Nutriments: 15-Day Total Body Cleanse or B-GUARD for

maintenance or strictly as a cleanse, then we recommend a minimum of

twice per year, and you can increase this based on what your body is telling

you.

What are possible reactions to the cleanse?

The cleanse is helping your body get rid of many toxins. Other than

bowel movements first thing in the morning, you will have more energy,

your skin will become more subtle and clear, your thought processes will

become much clearer, no more gas or bloating (if you do get gas or bloating

from B-GUARD or the 15-Day Total Body Cleanse, you will need to take

C-GUARD: Candida Clear because you most likely have Candida), water

retention will decrease. You could get a runny stool from B-GUARD. If so,

decrease your dose the next night. There are no “bad” reactions to B-

GUARD if taken as directed

By scraping out the toxins, some may be released and absorbed into your

body. This is only temporary and should pass quickly as your system

becomes cleaner. People who have never cleansed in their life usually feel

slight discomfort more pronounced than those who have been cleansing

regularly. Think of it like washing your car − if you haven’t washed your car

in years, the water is going to be really dirty and your towels will have the

side effect of also getting dirty. But if you wash your car once a month after

your last wash, everything will be much cleaner, including the towels.

Should I change my diet while I’m on the cleanse?

While there is no need to change your diet. It is recommended that

you eat and drink healthy choices as part of a healthy lifestyle. Eat

vegetables (raw whenever possible) and drink plenty of water, and lean

proteins such as chicken and fish. However, do what is comfortable for you.

What Juice should I use to take the cleanse with?

We recommend using green juices which are the best because they

have a higher pH. Purified water is the best choice because water has a

neutral pH.

How much fluid should I drink while cleansing?

Staying hydrated is of utmost importance while on the cleanse. Drink

as much as you wish to make the experience a good one.

Proper hydration is 1 ounce of water per 2 pounds of body weight each day,

or more if you are highly active.

If you are dehydrated, the common symptoms are:

- Lightheadedness

- Headache

- Tired and lethargic

- Dry Mouth and Lips

- Infrequent or small amounts of urination (less than three or four times per

day.)

What happens if I miss a serving?

No problem, simply continue to your next scheduled serving. If you

are taking any other cleanser (L-GUARD or H-GUARD for instance) then

you should not take that cleanser unless you are taking B-GUARD every

night. You want to remove the toxins that you are cleaning from other

organs from the body and that is accomplished with bowel movements, so it

is not healthy to cleanse the liver and not remove the toxins from the body

through a bowel movement.

How should I expect to feel during the cleanse?

Each person is different. Some people don’t notice much of a change

until after the cleanse, while others may feel more energetic during the

cleanse. The first two or three days you may feel lethargic and short of

-- 2 of 5 --

energy as the body is eliminating toxins that it has had stored for a length of

time and perhaps many years. As you eliminate these unwanted pollutants

from the body, there is a short period of detox. This last for the first few

days and then the increased energy, better mood, beautiful complexion, and

weight reduction occur. Please note: depending on your diet, you may feel

full and eat less while cleansing.

Will I be running to the bathroom all the time?

No, not if you take B-GUARD as directed. B-GUARD is designed to

take at night and the result is a larger than regular bowel movement in the

morning. Your bathroom frequency might increase over what it is now, but

the 15-Day Total Body Cleanse is not a laxative and will not cause you to

race to the bathroom at inconvenient times. If you take too many, you may

end up in the bathroom a few times in the day. Self regulation is important

when taking B-GUARD with a comfortable and effective process.

Will I feel bloated while taking the cleanse?

No, some cleansers will bloat naturally because that is what they are

designed to do. In the case of Psyllium Husks, which are meant to expand

as water fills the husks, create pressure to facilitate a bowel movement. This

pressure can create bloating. Candida or Epstein Barr can also create

bloating. B-GUARD on the other hand does not create bloating.

Will I experience weight loss?

Many users have experienced weight loss because one of the benefits

of a cleanse is releasing toxins and waste that you have been carrying in the

intestinal tract. The elimination process will remove old toxic fecal matter,

old food stuff, yeast and mold and water from the intestinal tract that clings

to your colon walls. The elimination of these stored materials will result in

some amount of weight reduction upon completing the cleanse. The above

listed removal of the old toxic fecal matter will also allow your body to use

nutrients more effectively, increasing your energy levels, and this may lead

to a more active lifestyle and to further weight loss.

Can I use alcohol while on the cleanse?

Alcohol is not recommended at any time. It is best not to use alcohol

during the cleanse. But if you wish you can drink alcohol when cleansing as

-- 3 of 5 --

it may not harm you if you do. At any time, alcohol is not meant to be a

substitution for your water intake.

Note; the consumption of alcohol may decrease some of the bodies

necessary energy to cleanse properly, plus you want to be fully hydrated

when are taking the cleanse, and alcohol does not help this and may lead to

problems inferior results.

When will I start to see toxic fecal matter?

Depending on many factors, but if you can recognize it, it will appear

in the toilet after a large bowel movement. Some B-GUARD users report

seeing it in as little as just a few days, while others may not see it until the

end of their cleanse. Not everybody shows the same waste product as

others, but this doesn’t mean you’re not being cleansed. It is important to

do a full cycle of at least 15 days.

Why am I not seeing toxic fecal matter?

The fecal matter on your intestinal lining may be very thick or very

thin depending on your lifestyle, genetics, eating habits, and a variety of

other things. If a person doing the cleanse has a very thin coating of waste

product in their colon, it is possible to be passed through with your normal

stool and go unnoticed. However, if the person doing the cleanse has a thick

coating it, you may pass stools that appear rubbery and rope like.

I have health problems. Can I still take the cleanse?

Please consult with your physician before taking any supplements if

you have health problems. That said, these products are only eliminating

toxins and old fecal matter. You may have health problems because you are

constipated and have a toxic body, so you probably need to take these

cleansing products more than you think.

Why should I take the parasite cleanse along with the colon

cleanse?

1 out 4 people is known to have some sort of parasitic condition.

These parasites can enter the body from animals, water, food, and can be

air borne. Herbal parasitic cleansers are included the bowel cleansing

constituents because most people who are on a cleanse for some health

reason have chronic gas or weight gain, bad breathe, lethargic mental state,

and/or a sensation of not being full after eating. These are all symptoms of

-- 4 of 5 --

Parasitic condition. When incorporating the parasite cleanse with the bowel

cleanse you will rid your body of parasites, eggs and worms if you have

them.

Can I take a Probiotic while using the colon cleanse?

B-GUARD is extremely effective at ridding the colon of bad bacteria.

It is recommend that everyone take a good probiotic whether cleansing or

otherwise. It is important to take probiotics if you have constipation or

irritable bowel symptoms because this could be an indication that you do not

have enough good bacteria in your intestinal tract. Because of this, some

customers prefer to take the probiotics along with the colon cleanse as well

as after the cleanse. If you’re not going to take them during the cleanse,

then it is highly recommended all users of B-GUARD or the 15-Day Total

Body Cleanse use probiotics upon completion of the cleanse to re-establish

the healthy intestinal flora.

If I am on medication.

Can I still take the cleanse?

It is still possible to take the cleanse while on medication, however

please consult with your physician before taking any of the Nutriment

supplements. That said if you are on medication, this medication will be

utilized by the body normally and the toxicity that may be inherent to the

medication will be eliminated. If you are taking any medications, you should

increase your bowel movements.

If I’m on medication when should I take the cleanse?

If you are on medication and your physician gave you his/her approval

to start the cleanse make sure you take your medication at least 2 hours

before or after taking B-GUARD.

Always take the cleanse as directed, if on medication or otherwise.

Which drugs may interact with the cleanse?

There are no counter-indications except during pregnancy or lactating.

Do not take this product if pregnant or lactating. For children, this product

is safe, but half the adult dose is recommended.
