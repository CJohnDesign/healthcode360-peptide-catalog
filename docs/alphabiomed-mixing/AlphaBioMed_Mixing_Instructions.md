## General Reconstitution Protocol

### Materials Needed

- Bacteriostatic water (BAC water)
- Insulin syringe (typically 1 mL or 3 mL)
- Alcohol prep pad
- Peptide vial

### Steps

1. **Clean the vial stopper** with an alcohol prep pad. Allow to dry.
2. **Draw bacteriostatic water** into the syringe to the volume specified on the product label (e.g., 2 mL for a 10 mg vial).
3. **Inject the water** into the peptide vial. Aim the needle at the side of the vial to avoid direct stream onto the peptide cake.
4. **Swirl gently** — do not shake. Agitation can damage the peptide structure.
5. **Allow to dissolve** — most peptides dissolve within 1–2 minutes. If needed, roll the vial between your hands.
6. **Store refrigerated** at 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C) after reconstitution.

### Important Notes

- **Never use tap water or sterile water** for multi-dose vials. Bacteriostatic water contains a preservative (typically benzyl alcohol) that prevents bacterial growth.
- **Do not shake** — swirling or gentle rolling is sufficient.
- **Check product-specific IFU** for exact reconstitution volume, concentration, and shelf life (typically 90 days refrigerated).
- **Rotate injection sites** — abdomen, thigh, upper arm. Dispose of syringes in a sharps container.

## Reconstitution Volume Reference

| Vial Size | Typical BAC Water | Concentration (if 0.05 mg/unit) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| 5 mg      | 1–2 mL            | 0.025–0.05 mg/unit              |
| 10 mg     | 2 mL              | 0.05 mg/unit                    |
| 20 mg     | 4 mL              | 0.05 mg/unit                    |

*Always follow the product-specific IFU for exact volumes.*

## Troubleshooting

- **Peptide won't dissolve:** Ensure BAC water is at room temperature. Some peptides (e.g., BPC-157) may take longer. Do not heat.
- **Cloudy solution:** May indicate contamination. Do not use. Contact your provider.
- **Crystals in vial:** May have been frozen. Discard if reconstituted and then frozen.
